# VOMS Admin server v. 3.6.0

This release provides fixes to some outstanding bugs and improvements:

- Background tasks that update the VOMS database are now synchronized via a
  lock table in the database; this is useful for clustered deployments (like
  the CERN one) that have multiple active instances of the VOMS admin service
- Sign AUP reminders and notifications should not be sent to expired VO
  members
- Changes to logback configuration are now reloaded correctly at runtime

The full list of bug fixes and improvements is listed below.

### Bug fixes

{% include list-rfcs.liquid %}

### Installation and configuration

#### Upgrade from VOMS Admin Server >= 3.3.2

A [database upgrade][db-upgrade] is required to upgrade to VOMS Admin server
3.6.0. 

##### Java 8
The VOMS admin RPM explicitly requires Java 8 since version 3.4.0. While former
versions could run on earlier Java versions, 3.6.0 will not start unless it is
run on Java 8.

The output of `java -version` will tell which is the active version on your
system:

```
$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_121"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)
```

You can configure the active JRE using `update-alternatives`:

```
$ update-alternatives --config java
```

##### Runtime logging configuration reloading

To take advantage of runtime logging  configuration reloading, that is now
working correctly as a result of the fix of [this issue][VOMS-790]**,
after** the upgrade of the rpm to version 3.6.0, update your VOs logback
configuration either by:

- reconfiguring each VO, **or**
- updating manually the logback configuration files with the following
  command:

```bash
for vo in $(find /etc/voms-admin/ -type d | sed '1d'); do \
  cp /usr/share/voms-admin/templates/logback.xml $vo; \
done
```

#### Upgrade from earlier VOMS Admin Server versions

First upgrade to VOMS Admin version [3.3.2][voms-admin-332-rn] and then to 3.6.0.

#### Clean install

Follow the instructions in the VOMS [System Administrator Guide][sysadmin-guide].
